### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Mya and this is where I will keep all my nerdy little science projects! 
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a python program that will create a green screen like button map over my partner's dungeons and dragons maps so that he can reveal new terrain secretly to his remote group using the pillow and tkinter packages. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning data analysis skills using excel, python, R, SQL, and Tableau so watch out for those in upcoming projects! 
- ðŸ“« If you're looking to get in contact with me for interesting projects or job opportunities, please send me an email at myarcurtis@gmail.com! 
- Happy coding to you all! :)
